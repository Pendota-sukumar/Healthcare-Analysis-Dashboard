## 📊 Project Overview
- Analyzed 100k+ hospital encounters (10-year diabetes dataset).
- Goal: identify factors driving **patient readmissions** and propose solutions.
- Tools: **Python (Google Colab)** for cleaning + **Tableau Public** for dashboard.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Google Colab)
- Tableau Public (free version)
- Excel

## 🔎 Key Insights
- Overall **readmission rate = 12%**.
- **Patients 65+** have the highest readmission probability.
- **Top diagnoses**: Diabetes complications and hypertension drive most readmissions.
- **High medication count (>10)** = 2× higher readmission likelihood.
- Longer **length of stay** correlates with higher readmission.

## 💡 Business Impact
Reducing readmissions by just **10%** could save hospitals millions annually 
and improve patient satisfaction scores.
